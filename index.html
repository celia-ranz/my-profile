      <h2> Fashion 👠 </h2>
      <p>
      My passion for fashion lies in its unique blend of fun and creativity, serving as a vibrant canvas for individual expression that showcases our emotions, thoughts, and states of mind in endlessly diverse ways. It's a celebration of personal style that feels good, looks good, and radiates a unique essence, making each person's fashion journey distinctively their own.

      <h2> Culture 💃🪭🥢 </h2>
      <p>
      My passion for culture has been fueled by my journeys from Spain to Singapore and Tokyo, where mastering adaptability and immersing myself in diverse cultural tapestries has given me a profound sense of vitality and a fascination with the enriching outcomes of merging cultures in business, friendships, and discussions. This deep engagement with global cultures is what inspired me to pursue a Global BBA, recognizing the immense value and perspective that understanding different cultures brings to any professional and personal setting. The ultimate change lies in the world's individuals  working together as a team.

      <h2> The Sea 🌊 </h2>
      <p>
      Alone or with friends, paddle boarding or tanning on its shores, it's my sanctuary, where every moment is a treasure and every sound, a healing embrace. For me there is nothing that can't be fixed by  the sound of waves crashing gently towards the rocks. It is where I feel most alive.
